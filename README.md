# CMPT 315 Midterm: A University Course Registration System
This web application represents a university course registration system with multiple students and courses. A student can choose to register from a list of courses from different departments. While a student can register for any course, they must ensure first that a course they are enrolled in does not conflict with any other courses they have previously enrolled in. Such a conflict would be if the start times are at the same time. The system will check and prevent a student from then signing up for a course that has the same class start time as one they are already enrolled in.

_**NOTICE:** This application is simply a simulation of a real university course registration system and was done strictly for education purposes._
